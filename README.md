# GenericStudy

1 - Statistical test with python (test_chi2.py) :
Some tests to understand how to find the mean value of a distribution after experiments, with the khiÂ² function, Likelihood, and then with systematics errors simulated. 

2 - Graphics from these statistical tests 

3 - Two pdf used for my two oral presentations (both Bourgade_date pdf) :
Studies for the number of events for different pT(H)

4 - Internship report IN FRENCH (Rapport_L3_Bourgade-Manon.pdf) : 
Almost all the work I've done during my intership

5 - First mass scans with 2016 datas : 
Made for 3 pT(H) intervals (85-125 GeV, 125-200 GeV, 200-350 GeV). At the end, "bkg_0_xxxx" means that we multiplied the background of 2016 by 0-xxxx to simulate the scan we could have with the real background.
